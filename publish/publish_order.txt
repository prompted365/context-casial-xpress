# Casial Workspace Crate Publishing Order

Based on cargo metadata analysis, the workspace contains 3 crates (not 4 as initially expected):

## Dependency Graph Analysis

### casial-core (lib)
- **Type**: Library crate (`lib`)
- **Path**: `crates/casial-core/`
- **Dependencies**: Only external crates, no workspace dependencies
- **Status**: LEAF CRATE - can be published first

### casial-server (bin)  
- **Type**: Binary crate (`bin`)
- **Path**: `crates/casial-server/`
- **Dependencies**: Depends on `casial-core` (path dependency)
- **Status**: Depends on casial-core, must be published after

### casial-wasm (cdylib)
- **Type**: WASM library crate (`cdylib`)
- **Path**: `crates/casial-wasm/`
- **Dependencies**: Depends on `casial-core` (path dependency)
- **Status**: Depends on casial-core, must be published after

### casial-cli
- **Status**: Directory exists but no Cargo.toml found - NOT A WORKSPACE MEMBER

## Final Publishing Order

1. **casial-core** (must be first - no workspace dependencies)
2. **casial-server** (depends on casial-core)  
3. **casial-wasm** (depends on casial-core)

Note: casial-server and casial-wasm can potentially be published in parallel after casial-core is available on crates.io, as they don't depend on each other.

## Issues to Address

### License Inconsistencies
- casial-core: `license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"` ✓
- casial-server: `license_file = "../../LICENSE.md"` (should use SPDX expression)
- casial-wasm: `license_file = "../../LICENSE.md"` (should use SPDX expression)

### Missing README files  
- casial-core: `readme = "README.md"` but file may not exist in crate directory
- casial-server: `readme = null` 
- casial-wasm: `readme = null`

### Path Dependencies (CRITICAL)
Both casial-server and casial-wasm have path dependencies on casial-core:
```
"casial-core": {"source": null, "req": "*", "path": "..."}
```
This WILL FAIL during publish unless the path dependency also has a version.

## Recommendation
Fix license and path dependency issues before attempting to publish.

## PUBLICATION COMPLETED ✅
**Date:** 2025-09-15  
**Status:** All 3 crates successfully published to crates.io  
**Version:** 0.1.1 (bumped from 0.1.0 due to existing casial-core publication)

### Final Results:
1. ✅ casial-core v0.1.1 - Published at 2025-09-15T00:29:06.911809Z
2. ✅ casial-server v0.1.1 - Published at 2025-09-15T00:29:32.330673Z  
3. ✅ casial-wasm v0.1.1 - Published at 2025-09-15T00:29:47.694604Z

### Issues Resolved:
- Fixed license metadata to use SPDX expressions
- Added comprehensive README.md files for all crates
- Fixed path dependency versioning issues
- Resolved compilation errors and warnings
- Successfully built and tested all crates
